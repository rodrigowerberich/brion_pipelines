Multiple log messages from multiple stream have been merged together. The order of the logs is randomized and needs to be organized.

Each log message is of the following format\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pipeline\_id\ id\ encoding\ [body]\ next\_id\ }

\end{DoxyCode}


The messages are to be grouped by pipeline\+\_\+id and display in reverse order of id. The order is determined by the id and next id fields.

In a real scenario I would engage with the stakeholders to clarify some desired behavior, but since this is an exercise and due to time constraints I decided to take some assumptions instead. In the real world it is not a good practice to try to guess what your user wants, you should always ask them.

For these assumption, a couple of definitions are used, see the list of definitions later on\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Assumptions}{Assumptions}}\label{index_autotoc_md13}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Assumption 1\+: Between the 5 different parts of the message any whitespace can be used in any amount. Even before the first part of the log message.
\item Assumption 2\+: pipeline\+\_\+id is a "{}continous string"{}.
\item Assumption 3\+: Encoding is a "{}continuous string"{}
\item Assumption 4\+: id and next\+\_\+id are also "{}continous strings"{}
\item Assumption 5\+: If the body is encoded as ascii, all ascii characters are allowed, including \mbox{[}\mbox{]} without the need for any form of escape (These will cause some limitations which will be addressed later)
\item Assumption 6\+: If the message is ill-\/formed an warning will be saved, the user can chose to run in verbose mode to see those warnings.
\item Assumption 7\+: Any ill-\/formed message will be disregarded and the valid messages will be organized.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Definition 1\+: Continous string is a string where no whitespace characters is allowed.
\item Definition 2\+: Ill-\/formed "{}line"{} here is specified as any sequence of chars on a buffer that do no fall into the following pattern\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{(newline)(whitespaces)(Continous\ string)(whitespaces)(Continous\ string)(whitespaces)(Continous\ string)(whitespaces)([)(anything)(])(whitespaces)(Continuous\ string)(whitespaces)(end\ of\ line/file)}

\end{DoxyCode}

For more info on the structure and how to build, check the \doxysectlink{Readme}{readme}{0}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Software solution}{Software solution}}\label{index_autotoc_md16}
The solution was divided into 3 parts, parse (log\+\_\+message\+\_\+parser), orgazine (log\+\_\+message\+\_\+organizer) and the \doxylink{app_8cc}{app component}. There is also a log\+\_\+message components which is used to define a log\+\_\+message and remove a coupling from the organizer to the parser. There is also an external component used to build the CLI interface. \href{https://github.com/muellan/clipp}{\texttt{ Clipp}} was used for its lightweight, simple interface.

For more details on each part you can click on the components on the diagram below. I recommend starting with the app component.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Automated integration/application level tests.
\item Better documented unit tests.
\item Unit tests for the app level.
\item More options for parsing, different modes of parsing. Being less tolerant with brackets or, single line only mode.
\item Better parsing error detection and messages.
\item Option to order the termination ids and invalid ids by some criterium, e.\+g., alphabetical order, covert to int and sort, etc.
\item Chose a different CLI library that wouldn\textquotesingle{}t have problem compiling on clang and mvc. (I\textquotesingle{}ve had too strict options)
